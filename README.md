Title: Quiet is the new loudness

-- About the Project --

The soundscape of Modernity, with its overwhelming array of machine generated standing waves amplified in canyons of glass and steel, has through the vicissitudes of history passed Brugge by. One can still take delight in Brugge’s human scale sound space of passageways, plazas, canals, cobblestones and courtyards without being overwhelmed by electrical hums, diesel motors, helicopters, ventilation, air conditioning and constant media sounds. Brugge has a very valuable acoustic commodity: quiet. In a time where our accelerating economy generates an inhuman barrage of conflicting and confusing sounds out of scale with human perception Brugge’s quiet provides space to think. Quiet is the New Loud.

O+A, Odland and Auinger propose an artistic intervention that reveals both the historical acoustics and the information age infrastructure hidden beneath the cobblestones. The project will start with “Hearing Perspective” research into Brugge’s acoustics, resonance, architecture, proportions, materials, social usage to create a map of its sonic qualities. The final version of the elements below will emerge from this research: 

Songlines, mapping of curated pathways and listening spaces in Brugge’s soundspace; 
Iconic Brugge Speakers, lighter than air speakers mapped to GPS coordinates; 
Counterpoint , a square platform vibrating with the tuned sounds of modernity;

O+A will create a special lighter than air loudspeaker programmed with special acoustical signals, mapped to a gps coordinate grid. The Iconic Brugge Speakers will play only when the speaker is in the right GPS position. Every sound will be tuned precisely by O+A to quietly and briefly activate the special acoustics of each space on the “songline”. The experience is a self guided exploration for individuals and small groups, not a tour.
